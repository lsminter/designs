# Designs

This repo is to hold some of the sites that I've designed. This isn't a complete list and I've grown a large amount from project to project. They are listed in order of creation from newest to oldest. 

Each site had a specific learning goal with the most recent being centered on design. I dove into api calling and data manipulation, learning backend through Supabase and AI, Framer Motion for fun interactions, and my personal blog for diving further into Next.js. 

I've learned a ton on each of these project and look forward to continuing to learn and grow. 


## Portfolio Site - portfolio site ctec 270
This was a final assignment for my Web Design I class at Clark College. It's a site built on HTML and Bootstrap. It's a static site that links to some of my other work, a contact form, as well as some of my technical skills. 

## Coastal Memories Flexbox
This was an assignment in college where we were learning about Flexbox. I included this just as an example of me using flexbox. It's fairly simple but I feel gets the point across. 

## Tea Website
I'm apart of and am one of the moderators of an Old School RuneScape Clan. We do competitions within our clan and against other clans. As we've gained more an more members, over 200 at the current time of writing this, we noticed a need for centralizing all of our content. This site groups fetches data from wiseoldman.net using their API where we host our competitions and it records our individual data. I list out our most recent and current competitions with results as well as individual accomplishments.

## Dungeon Master Toolbox - dmtoolbox.app
This one started out as a small, for fun project to learn how to use chatGPT's api to create DND characters. It created a description and an image based off of some simple suggestions from the user. As I was building it out, I wanted to allow users to save their characters so I dove into Supabase to learn how to create a backend that would save their characters. I did some data fetching for different monsters so users could also create encounters for their campaigns.

## Imsoloh Website
One of my clan members, who goes by the name imsoloh, creates his own YouTube content based on Old School RuneScape. I created a simple site that utilizes Framer Motion to get some fun animations for buttons. It also fetches his most recent video from YouTube using YouTube's API.

## Lucas Minter Website: lucasminter.dev
My personal blog where I put notes on coding and personal life. It's built on Next.js and uses Sanity as the CMS. In Figma, I made a basic layout for what I was going to do for the site and iterated on that during development.
