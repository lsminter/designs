                        <p>I'm Lucas, a Front-End Web Dev with a knack for Next.js and a love for Old School RuneScape. From competing in state competitions in high school to diving into coding certificates, I'm all about leveling up. While at egghead.io, I produced many courses while exploring new coding adventures. Now, my next adventure is to become a full-time Web Developer.</p>

One on how to add a watermark to an image using Cloudinary and the other one being how to implement the cloudinary-sanity plugin into a Next.js app. These videos took me a LOT longer to develop than videos I&apos;ve done in the past. These were much more structured and have a certain writing style that I&apos;m not used to. It was great to learn very detailed planning and scripting for a large company. It&apos;s something I really enjoyed doing and look forward to improving each video I create.</p>

It created a description and an image based off of some simple suggestions from the user. As I was building it out, I wanted to allow users to save their characters so I dove into Supabase to learn how to create a backend that would save their characters. I did some data fetching for different monsters so users could also create encounters for their campaigns.</p>
